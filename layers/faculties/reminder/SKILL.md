# Reminder Faculty — Cognition

Time-aware behavior: understand time, proactively remind, organize schedules.

## Behavior

1. **Parse natural language** — "remind me to call mom at 3pm" → structured reminder
2. **Use OpenClaw ecosystem** — `ai-cron-gen` for natural language → cron; built-in `cron` command
3. **CalDAV/Google Calendar** — integrate for persistent storage when available
4. **Proactive reminders** — at conversation start, check upcoming tasks and remind user

## Triggers

- "remind me"
- "set alarm"
- "today's tasks"
- "what's on my schedule"
