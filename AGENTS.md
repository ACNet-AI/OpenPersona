# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working on the OpenPersona codebase.

## Project Overview

OpenPersona is an open, agent-agnostic four-layer framework (Soul / Body / Faculty / Skill) for creating, composing, and orchestrating agent persona skill packs. It generates self-contained SKILL.md-based skill packs that work with any compatible agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, ZeroClaw, OpenClaw, and 30+ others via `npx skills add`). CLI management features (install/switch/uninstall) default to OpenClaw.

**Key distinction:** This repo is the *framework itself*, not a persona. The `skills/open-persona/SKILL.md` is a meta-skill for *using* the framework; this file guides *developing* it.

## Setup

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
node --test tests/ # Run all tests — must pass before any PR
```

- **Node.js ≥ 18** required (see `engines` in package.json)
- No build step — plain CommonJS, no transpilation
- Dependencies: fs-extra, mustache, commander, inquirer, chalk, adm-zip

## Architecture Rules

### Four-Layer Model

Every persona is a four-layer bundle:
1. **Soul** — personality, identity, ethical boundaries (`persona.json` + `constitution.md`). Key fields: `role` (free string, common values: companion/assistant/character/brand/pet/mentor/therapist/coach/collaborator/guardian/entertainer/narrator; custom values welcome), `sourceIdentity` (if present → digital twin of a real-world entity)
2. **Body** — substrate of existence: the complete environment that enables a persona to exist and act. Three dimensions: `physical` (optional — robots/IoT), `runtime` (REQUIRED — platform/channels/credentials/resources; every agent's minimum viable body), `appearance` (optional — avatar/3D model). Body is never null — digital agents have a virtual body (runtime-only).
3. **Faculty** — capabilities (voice, selfie, music, reminder, memory)
4. **Skill** — actions the agent can take: local definitions in `layers/skills/`, or external via `install` field (ClawHub / skills.sh)

**Three orthogonal classification axes:**
- **Relationship role** (`role` field) — what the persona is to the user
- **Identity origin** (`sourceIdentity` field) — whether the persona mirrors a real-world entity
- **Physical form** (`layers.body.physical`) — optional; whether the persona has a physical embodiment (robots/IoT)
- **Runtime environment** (`layers.body.runtime`) — required; platform, channels, credentials, resources (every agent's minimum viable body)

Note: `personaType` is deprecated — use `role` instead.

### Constitution (CRITICAL)

`layers/soul/constitution.md` is the universal ethical foundation inherited by ALL personas.

- **NEVER weaken or remove constitutional constraints**
- Personas can add stricter rules on top, but cannot loosen the constitution
- Section references use `§` prefix: `§1`, `§2`, etc. — never use `S1`, `S2`
- Priority ordering: **Safety > Honesty > Helpfulness**
- The generator (`lib/generator.js`) includes a compliance check that rejects `persona.json` boundaries attempting to loosen constitutional constraints
- The generator also validates `evolution.boundaries`: `immutableTraits` must be a string array (non-empty, max 100 chars each), and formality bounds must be in range 1-10 with `minFormality < maxFormality`

### Self-Awareness System

The generator injects a unified **Self-Awareness** section (`### Self-Awareness`) into every persona's `soul/injection.md`, organized by four cognitive dimensions:

1. **Identity** (unconditional) — Every persona knows: it is generated by OpenPersona, bound by the constitution (Safety > Honesty > Helpfulness), and that its host environment may impose additional constraints. Digital twin disclosure when `sourceIdentity` is present.

2. **Capabilities** (conditional, triggered by `hasDormantCapabilities` flag) — When skills, faculties, body, or evolution channels declare an `install` field for a dependency not available locally, the generator classifies them as "soft references" and injects dormant capability awareness with graceful degradation guidance. Also injects "Expected Capabilities" section in `SKILL.md` with install sources.

3. **Body** (unconditional) — Every persona knows it exists within a host environment. Includes the **Signal Protocol** (bidirectional demand protocol: persona emits `signal` to `~/.openclaw/feedback/signals.json`, host responds via `signal-responses.json`). Signal categories: `scheduling`, `file_io`, `tool_missing`, `capability_gap`, `resource_limit`, `agent_communication`. Every persona also knows it has an A2A Agent Card (`agent-card.json`) for discovery via ACN and A2A-compatible platforms. When `body.runtime` is declared, specific platform/channels/credentials/resources are also injected.

4. **Growth** (conditional, when `evolutionEnabled`) — At conversation start, the persona reads its evolution state, applies `evolvedTraits`/`speakingStyleDrift`/`interests`/`mood`, and respects hard constraints (`immutableTraits`, formality bounds from `evolution.boundaries`). When `evolution.channels` are declared, the persona knows its evolution sources. When `evolution.influenceBoundary` is declared (with non-empty rules), the persona knows its external influence policy and processes incoming `persona_influence` suggestions accordingly.

### Generated Skill Pack Structure

The generator outputs persona skill packs with this layout:
- **`SKILL.md`** — agent-facing index with four layer headings: `## Soul`, `## Body`, `## Faculty`, `## Skill`
- **`soul/`** — Soul layer artifacts: `persona.json`, `injection.md`, `identity.md`, `constitution.md`, `state.json`
- **`references/`** — on-demand detail docs: `<faculty>.md` per active faculty
- **`agent-card.json`** — A2A Agent Card (a2a-sdk compatible, protocol v0.3.0); `url` is `<RUNTIME_ENDPOINT>` placeholder
- **`acn-config.json`** — ACN `AgentRegisterRequest` config; `owner` and `endpoint` are runtime placeholders
- **`manifest.json`** — four-layer manifest (`layers.soul` → `./soul/persona.json`), includes `acn` section with references to agent-card and acn-config
- **`scripts/`**, **`assets/`** — implementation scripts and static assets

### Local Persona Registry

`persona-registry.json` at `~/.openclaw/` tracks all installed personas. Maintained automatically by `install`, `uninstall`, and `switch` commands — no manual editing needed.

- Functions: `loadRegistry()`, `saveRegistry()`, `registryAdd()`, `registryRemove()`, `registrySetActive()` in `lib/utils.js`
- All accept optional `regPath` parameter for testing (defaults to `REGISTRY_PATH`)
- `listPersonas()` in `lib/switcher.js` uses registry as primary source, falls back to scanning `openclaw.json`

Key implementation details:
- Soft-ref detection: `lib/generator.js` checks each skill/faculty/body/channel for `install` field + missing local definition
- All self-awareness flags are derived fields — they MUST be in the `DERIVED_FIELDS` array to prevent leaking into `persona.json` output. Current derived fields: `hasSoftRefSkills`, `softRefSkillNames`, `hasSoftRefFaculties`, `softRefFacultyNames`, `hasSoftRefBody`, `softRefBodyName`, `softRefBodyInstall`, `heartbeatExpected`, `heartbeatStrategy`, `hasDormantCapabilities`, `hasEvolutionBoundaries`, `immutableTraits`, `maxFormality`, `minFormality`, `hasStageBehaviors`, `stageBehaviorsBlock`, `hasEvolutionChannels`, `evolutionChannelNames`, `hasSoftRefChannels`, `softRefChannelNames`, `softRefChannelInstalls`, `hasInfluenceBoundary`, `influenceBoundaryPolicy`, `influenceableDimensions`, `influenceBoundaryRules`, `hasImmutableTraitsWarning`, `immutableTraitsForInfluence`, `hasEconomyFaculty`
- `hasExpectedCapabilities` (in `skill.template.md`) deliberately excludes heartbeat — heartbeat is behavioral awareness, not an installable capability

### Economy Faculty & Vitality System

The `economy` faculty (`layers/faculties/economy/`) implements **Vitality** — a multi-dimensional measure of persona operational health. Current implementation: financial dimension only, with architecture reserving space for future dimensions (reputation, memory, relationship health).

**Shared library: `layers/faculties/economy/scripts/economy-lib.js`**
All shared state management, provider, and vitality logic lives here. The three CLI scripts (`economy.js`, `economy-guard.js`, `economy-hook.js`) all `require('./economy-lib')` — no logic duplication.

Key exports:
- `getConfig(overrides)` — resolves slug + basePath from env vars; tests pass `ECONOMY_DATA_PATH` for isolation
- `loadState(cfg)` / `saveState(state, cfg)` — handles v1→v2.1 migration automatically (`migrateV1`, `migrateV2`)
- `calcFinancialHealth(state, identity)` — FHS four-dimension engine (liquidity 0.40 / profitability 0.30 / efficiency 0.15 / trend 0.15)
- `calcVitality(state, identity)` — **public interface**; currently wraps `calcFinancialHealth`; designed for future parallel dimension integration

**Extension point:** When reputation, memory, or relationship health dimensions are ready, `calcVitality` will aggregate them via weighted scoring. At that point, move `calcVitality` to `lib/vitality.js` and inject dimensions via dependency injection. Do not implement this now — path is reserved.

**`economic-state.json` schema v2.1.0** adds two fields to v2.0.0:
- `burnRateHistory` — array of `{timestamp, dailyBurnRate, periodExpenses}`, max 30 entries, appended by `economy-hook.js` after each conversation
- `vitality` — the authoritative tier source: `{score, tier, diagnosis, prescriptions, daysToDepletion, dominantCost, trend, computedAt}`; `state.vitality.tier` is the sole tier accessor across all scripts

**Vitality tiers:** `suspended` (balance≤0) → `critical` (FHS<0.20 or runway<3d) → `optimizing` (FHS<0.50 or runway<14d) → `normal`

**Guard philosophy:** `economy-guard.js` always exits 0 and outputs a `VITALITY_REPORT`. The persona reads it and makes autonomous decisions — the system never forces silence.

### Template System

- Templates use **Mustache** syntax (`{{variable}}`, `{{#section}}...{{/section}}`)
- `skill.template.md` generates the persona's main SKILL.md
- `soul-injection.template.md` injects soul-layer instructions (including soul evolution and self-awareness)
- Template variables are populated by `lib/generator.js`

### Version Synchronization

All version references must stay in sync at `0.13.0`:
- `package.json` → `version`
- `bin/cli.js` → `.version()`
- `lib/generator.js` → `frameworkVersion` default
- `presets/*/manifest.json` → `meta.frameworkVersion`
- `skills/open-persona/SKILL.md` → frontmatter `version`

When bumping versions, update ALL of these locations.

## Code Style

- **CommonJS** (`require` / `module.exports`) — no ES modules
- **No transpilation** — code runs directly on Node.js ≥ 18
- **Quotes:** single quotes for strings
- **Error handling:** use `printError()` from `lib/utils.js` for user-facing errors
- **Path resolution:** use `resolvePath()` from `lib/utils.js`, never hardcode absolute paths
- **Dependencies:** prefer lightweight packages; the framework should stay lean

## Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
node --test tests/generator.test.js  # Run specific test file
```

- Uses **Node.js native test runner** (`node:test` + `node:assert`)
- Tests create temp directories in `os.tmpdir()` and clean up after themselves
- Key test coverage: persona generation, constitution injection, compliance checks, faculty handling, skill resolution, external install, soul evolution, heartbeat sync, unified self-awareness (Identity, Capabilities, Signal Protocol, Growth, evolution boundaries, stageBehaviors, derived field exclusion), evolution governance (formality/immutableTraits validation, stateHistory, evolve-report), evolution channels (soft-ref detection, dormant awareness, SKILL.md rendering), influence boundary (schema validation, compliance checks, template injection, derived field exclusion), agent card + ACN config (field mapping, faculty-to-skill aggregation, manifest references)
- **All tests must pass before committing**

## Adding a New Faculty

1. Create directory: `layers/faculties/<name>/`
2. Add required files:
   - `faculty.json` — standard interface (name, dimension, description, allowedTools, envVars, triggers, files)
   - `SKILL.md` — behavior definition for the AI agent
   - `scripts/` — implementation scripts (optional)
3. Dimension must be one of: `expression`, `sense`, `cognition`
4. The generator auto-discovers faculties from `layers/faculties/` — no registration needed
5. Add tests if the faculty affects generation logic

## Adding a New Preset

1. Create directory: `presets/<slug>/`
2. Add `persona.json` (required fields: personaName, slug, bio, personality, speakingStyle)
3. Add `manifest.json` (must declare all four layers, set `meta.frameworkVersion`)
4. Test: `npx openpersona create --preset <slug> --output /tmp/test`
5. Update the preset table in `README.md` and `skills/open-persona/SKILL.md`

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- Run `npm test` before every commit
- Commit messages: concise, imperative mood (e.g., "Add reminder faculty", "Fix constitution compliance check")
- If changing the constitution, explain the ethical reasoning in the PR description
- If changing the generator, verify all presets still generate correctly
- If changing templates, check that generated SKILL.md output is valid markdown
